three letters of the from address, followed by the first two letters of the courier id and the first three letters of the to address. The courier code should be in 
upper case. Write a query to display courier details like courier id, branch id and courier code. Give an alias name for the courier code as 'COURIER_CODE'. Sort the 
results based on the booking date in ascending order.
